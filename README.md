# Understanding Artificial Intelligence

This material is intended to give you an understanding of some of the basic ideas in artificial intelligence - specifically, machine learning, deep learning, and AI alignment.  To that end, it is divided into four parts, each intended to give you a foundation in a different learning area.

* **Part I** is to give you an understanding of the very fundamental principles behind machine learning and deep learning, as well as an introductory dive into what AI alignment is, and why it's necessary.  
This part is meant to give you enough of a conceptual base to not be entirely lost when you try programming or studying further into it.
* **Part II** goes deeper into the concepts.  You'll see your first machine learning algorithm, see what it looks like in a Python program, and then try it on your own.  You'll also understand more about deep learning, and see what a Python program for it looks like, and try your own model using transfer learning (It'll make sense when you get there).  
This part is mainly meant to give you a brief look into what the programming side of AI looks like, and prepare you to deal with new programs and models.
* **Part III** deals with a few specific algorithms and how they work.  
This part is meant to give you a theoretical base to accustom you to the type of mathematical thinking AI deals with.
* **Part IV** comes back to AI alignment, and dives further into some of the core ideas and thinking behind it, as well as the nature of intelligence.  
This part is meant to give you more than a basic idea of the state of Friendly AI research, and give you a stepping-off point to understand what AI *is*, beyond a few opaque theorems and lines of code.
