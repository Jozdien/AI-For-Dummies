# Part the 4th - Artificial Intelligence

Our bodies are shells for a small, squishy, slimy lump of gray, white, and red.  The kind of thing that if you saw on the side of the road, you'd go out of the way to avoid.  It looks like the most damage it could do to you is your own disgust.

Humanity did not become the most powerful species on the planet because we had the strongest muscles, the sharpest claws, or the toughest hides.  Millions of years ago, the rulers of the land were animals who were really good in those niches, and really, those niches alone - what could travel by day and night, could travel through the land, water, and skies, or even just have a good offence and defence at the same time?  Well, as it turns out, the small squishy lumps.  No armour, no claws, no poison, and somehow, able to weather every climate, cut diamonds, and cure plagues.

Now imagine someone smarter than us.

It's hard to picture what exactly AI can do.  The idea of someone curing cancer, or visiting Mars, is evocative, a powerful image.  But if someone told you there was one single technique that could cure every disease, take us to Mars, to Jupiter, to Alpha Centauri, that could create the grand unified theory, end hunger, end ageing, make everyone intelligent, crack the genetic code - you get the point - it'd just sound like they were trying to sell you something.

But we do already have one thing that cured smallpox and took us to the Moon and created science.  Sure, we don't fully understand what that thing is yet, but that's our fault, not some quality of intelligence that makes it not-understandable.  Lightning seemed like it was beyond our understanding and control before electricity.  And our understanding of intelligence only increases over time.  And that which we understand, we can create.

There's a quote from Eliezer Yudkowsky, one of the largest names in AI Safety (and one you'll see in this part often), that applies here:
> There’s a popular concept of “intelligence” as book smarts, like calculus or chess, as opposed to say social skills. So people say that “it takes more than intelligence to succeed in human society”. But social skills reside in the brain, not the kidneys. When you think of intelligence, don’t think of a college professor, think of human beings; as opposed to chimpanzees.

Intelligence is the source of technology.  What happens when we use that technology to better our intelligence?  We could create better scientific theories, medicines, movies, but most of all, we could use it to take our intelligence even further.  That's a cycle with an upper limit so far away we can't see it yet, or even know if it exists.  It's a runaway intelligence explosion, better known as the Singularity.  When you consider this, the next few decades become quite probably the most important in human history and its future.

## What's Intelligence?

> AI is whatever hasn't been done yet.*
\- Larry Tesler

*I usually leave the recommendation for further reading to the end, but in this case, it's important enough that it has to be said in the beginning: Godel Escher Bach is the greatest book ever written on the nature of intelligence, one of the greatest books *ever*, and a very entertaining read about music, art, philosophy, surrealism, literature, programming - you name it, Douglas Hofstadter's probably written about it. If you came up to me with no prior knowledge about *anything* related to AI but wanted to get into it, this is what I'd give you (well, not *give* you because I probably wouldn't trust you with my copy).*

### Human Bias

The first task when we're dealing with knowing more about intelligence is the very *human* traits that we unknowingly think of as a property of all intelligence.
